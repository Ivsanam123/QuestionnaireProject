# SOSH Happiness Questionnaire 1
This is a happiness questionnaire inspired by the book "The How of Happiness" by Sonja Lyubomirsky, which is referenced in the course "Science of Sustainable Happiness" that I took at my college. The website allows you to answer questions that determine your happiness score based on an algorithm described in the aforementioned book.
